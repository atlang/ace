# Ace

Ace is an extensible, statically-typed programming language that borrows Python's syntax and uses Python as a type-level metalanguage. Or to put it more simply -- it is embedded within Python.

Ace is still under development. If you'd like to help, get in touch with Cyrus (see below). If you'd like to be informed when Ace is more ready for you, join the ace-announce mailing list:

# Extensions
## OpenCL

The most well-developed set of extensions included with Ace implement the entirety of the OpenCL kernel programming language, (and include a wrapper around the host API as well). Ace is the best way to write low-level GPU kernels in OpenCL today, no contest.

## C99

A not-quite-complete set of extensions that implement the C99 programming language are also included.
